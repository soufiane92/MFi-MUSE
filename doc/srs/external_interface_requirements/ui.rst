The UI consists of a basic layout with a file menu bar, tabbed graphics
windows, a mode area, mode selection bar, and a console, illustrated in
Figure 1. Splitters will resize/hide the mode area

and the graphics area as well as hide/resize the console. Widgets listed
in the mode area will change based on the user model selections.
