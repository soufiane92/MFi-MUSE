About MFIX
----------

MFIX is an open-source multiphase flow solver, providing a Two-Fluid Model
(TFM), a Particle In Cell (PIC) model, a Discrete Element Model (DEM), and
a Hybrid model. These models can be used to simulate a variety of multiphase
flow devices including gasifiers, circulating fluid bed combusters, fluidized
beds, fluid catalytic crackers, and chemical looping combustion systems. Please
visit the `Multiphase Flow Science <https://mfix.netl.doe.gov/>`__ website for
