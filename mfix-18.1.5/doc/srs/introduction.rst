Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions
-----------------------------------------

The intended audience for this document is primarily project managers,
GUI developers, and MFIX users. The secondary audience will be code
testers, and documentation writers. This primary purpose of the document
is to capture the design and performance specifications in one location
so that the project scope can be defined and managed.

Product Scope
-------------

A comprehensive graphical user interface (GUI) for interacting with the
MFIX Suite of multiphase flow software will be developed. The purpose of
the GUI will be to provide a user-friendly interface to:

-  Set up the MFIX simulation;
-  Control and interact with the MFIX code during execution;
-  Provide post-processing capabilities for analyzing output data;

While developing this capability, we will monitor progress of
other development teams that are also creating MFIX enhancements (MFIX
Development, REMS toolkit development, UQ toolkit development) and
provide these groups with information on GUI capabilities and
incremental GUI code beta releases.
